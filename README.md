# DBGroupProject

Introduction: Hi! We are group 9 and in this project we will be working with the Campus Eats Script in MySQL WorkBench. We will be creating a rating system for the delivery services that will rate drivers and restaurants. 

Business Rules: 
  1. Only students can be drivers.
  2. Restaurants must be approved before entered in the system.
  3. Only one rating per order can be submitted.
  4. Ratings are optional.
  5. There must be at least 10 restaurants in the database.
  6. Individual orders must come from one restaurant.
